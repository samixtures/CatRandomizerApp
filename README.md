# CatRandomizer!
The first page displays this screen, with these three buttons.

Upon clicking on one of the buttons, the app takes the user to a page with a cat picture to assist them with their specific mood.
I have added the cat pictures in this repository.

When clicking on the sad button, the page may redirect you to this image with a button at the bottom that says "start over" so that you may go back to the first page if desired.

When clicking on the angry button, the page will redirect (not "may redirect" because I have only uplaoded this one picture to for the angry image button) you to this image with a button at the bottom that says "start over" so that you may go back to the first page if desired.
